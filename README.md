# suicide_rate
The data_preprocessing files (*countries_preprocessing.ipynb* and *Suicidedata_preprocessing.ipynb*) are files that clean up the datasets and visualize features and distributions of the datasets. 

The database file (*suicide_database.ipynb*) uses **sqlite** to link the different datasets, allowing easy retrieval of data.

The machine learning file (*suicie_machine_learning.ipynb*) discusses the regression models used to predict suicide rate, and make inferences on what features are important predictors.
